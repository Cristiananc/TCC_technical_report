### Structure of simulations

* Creating trajectories;
* Repeat simulations;
* Phylodynamic reconstruction;
* Summaries of the reconstruction;
* Calculate performance metrics.


Functions folder

R folder
The trajectories are input as a parameter;
01-simulation-sample-genealogies (genealogies is the output)
02-simulation-effepop-reconstruction (reconstruction is the output)
(if we want we can plot the random simulations but they are not part of the 
default pipline of the simulations)
03-simulation-perfomance-metrics (we export the performance metrics)
(if we want we can produce the summaries in order to plot the effective 
population size)

With this organization we can generate the simulations for different trajectories
that  we input in the functions.
